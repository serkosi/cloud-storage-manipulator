# Connecting to an Excel Sheet in OneDrive using Microsoft Graph API

This guide explains how to connect to an Excel sheet in OneDrive using the OneDrive API, specifically through the Microsoft Graph API. This API allows you to read and modify Excel workbooks stored in OneDrive.

## Overview

Here's a high-level overview of how to achieve this:

1. **Set Up Microsoft Graph API**: Register your app in the Azure portal to get the necessary credentials (client ID and secret) to access the Microsoft Graph API.
2. **Authenticate**: Use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate your app and get an access token. This token will allow your app to make requests to the Microsoft Graph API.
3. **Access the Excel File**: Use the Microsoft Graph API to access the Excel file stored in OneDrive. You can use the `/me/drive/root:/path/to/excel/file` endpoint to get the file.
4. **Read and Write Data**: The Microsoft Graph API provides endpoints to read and write data in Excel workbooks. You can use these endpoints to update the Excel sheet based on the input from your mobile app.
5. **Build the Mobile App**: Use a framework like Xamarin or React Native to build your mobile app. Integrate the Microsoft Graph API into your app to interact with the Excel file in OneDrive.

## Resources

Here are some useful resources to get started:

- [Microsoft Graph API Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview)
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/?view=odsp-graph-online
- [Working with Excel in Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/excel?view=graph-rest-1.0)
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/excel?view=graph-rest-1.0

This setup will allow you to create a mobile app that can read from and write to an Excel sheet in OneDrive, enabling you to update the sheet based on user input from your Android device.
