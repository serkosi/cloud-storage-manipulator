# Connecting to an Excel Sheet in OneDrive using Microsoft Graph API

This guide explains how to connect to an Excel sheet in OneDrive using the OneDrive API, specifically through the Microsoft Graph API. This API allows you to read and modify Excel workbooks stored in OneDrive.

## Overview

Here's a high-level overview of how to achieve this:

1. **Set Up Microsoft Graph API**: Register your app in the Azure portal to get the necessary credentials (client ID and secret) to access the Microsoft Graph API.
2. **Authenticate**: Use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate your app and get an access token. This token will allow your app to make requests to the Microsoft Graph API.
    - ***API Permissions***: Go to the "API permissions" section and add the necessary permissions for Microsoft Graph. For accessing and modifying Excel files, you will need permissions like Files.ReadWrite and Sites.ReadWrite.All.
    
    Using the client credentials flow, you need to use application permissions and access the file using the /users/{userId} or /drives/{driveId} endpoints instead.

    Add Permissions:
    - Click on "Add a permission".
    - Select "Microsoft Graph".
    - Choose "Application permissions" (since you're using the client credentials flow).
    - Add the following permissions:
        * User.Read.All
        * Files.ReadWrite.All
        * Sites.ReadWrite.All

    Grant Admin Consent:
    - After adding the permissions, you need to grant admin consent for these permissions.
    - Click on the "Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]" button.

    Certificates & Secrets:

    In the "Certificates & secrets" section, create a new client secret. This secret will be used along with the client ID to authenticate your app.

    Authentication:

    Ensure that the "Mobile and desktop applications" platform is configured correctly with the Redirect URI.

    Microsoft Graph API:

    Use the Microsoft Graph API to interact with the Excel file in OneDrive. You can use endpoints like /me/drive/root:/path/to/excel/file to access the file and perform read/write operations.

    Code Implementation:

    In your mobile app (e.g., using Xamarin), implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain the access token.

    Use the access token to make API calls to Microsoft Graph and interact with the Excel file.


3. **Access the Excel File**: Use the Microsoft Graph API to access the Excel file stored in OneDrive. You can use the `/me/drive/root:/path/to/excel/file` endpoint to get the file.
4. **Read and Write Data**: The Microsoft Graph API provides endpoints to read and write data in Excel workbooks. You can use these endpoints to update the Excel sheet based on the input from your mobile app.
5. **Build the Mobile App**: Use a framework like Xamarin or React Native to build your mobile app. Integrate the Microsoft Graph API into your app to interact with the Excel file in OneDrive.

## Resources

Here are some useful resources to get started:

- [Microsoft Graph API Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview)
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/?view=odsp-graph-online
- [Working with Excel in Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/excel?view=graph-rest-1.0)

This setup will allow you to create a mobile app that can read from and write to an Excel sheet in OneDrive, enabling you to update the sheet based on user input from your Android device.

Create a Confidential Client Application:

Initialize the msal.ConfidentialClientApplication with your client ID, authority, and client secret.
Get the Authorization URL:

Use app.get_authorization_request_url to generate the URL where the user will log in and authorize your app.
Print this URL and ask the user to visit it.
Capture the Authorization Code:

After the user authorizes the app, they will be redirected to the redirect URI with a code.
Capture this code from the URL.
Exchange the Authorization Code for an Access Token:

Use app.acquire_token_by_authorization_code to exchange the authorization code for an access token.
Check if the access token is successfully acquired.
Use the Access Token:

Use the access token to make authenticated requests to the Microsoft Graph API.
Replace your_client_id, your_client_secret, and /path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx with your actual values. This script will guide the user through the authentication process and allow you to access and update the Excel file in OneDrive.
